##  About Me

Hi, I’m **Khwahish**,  a passionate **Full Stack Developer** and **Cloud Engineer**.  
I craft fast, responsive, and secure web applications using modern stacks and cloud-native tools.

> *“I'm a developer. ~~I break things,~~ I fix things, and I build things that matter.”*

Currently, I’m focused on:
-  Building my handcrafted **personal portfolio**
-  Mastering scalable full stack & cloud architecture
-  Pushing meaningful projects and open-source work


> *"I don’t chase trends. I build what works."*  
> *Clean code, clear thinking, and quiet execution, that’s the focus.*
